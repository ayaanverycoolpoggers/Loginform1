<!-- SECTION 1: HISTORY & PITCH -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>Our Story & Mission</h2>

    <p>
        Growing up, I constantly heard people look at polluted water and say, “I wish I could do something about it.”
        WorldOfUs was created to turn that wish into action. Our mission is simple: to make environmental action
        accessible to everyone, not just governments or billion-dollar organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me ask you this: can the average person really make a major difference in protecting the environment?
        At WorldOfUs, we believe the answer is yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our product is called the Deplasticer. It’s a modular filtration device designed to remove plastic,
        microplastics, and other debris from water. The Deplasticer allows individuals, communities, and companies
        to take environmental cleanup into their own hands—starting with the water systems they use every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        What makes the Deplasticer unique is its scalability. Unlike current solutions, such as the Interceptor used
        in TeamSeas, our technology works across multiple environments. The Deplasticer comes in different sizes,
        allowing it to clean household pipes, rivers, lakes, and even oceans.
    </p>

    <p>
        Smaller models are affordable and compact enough to fit into tight spaces like pipes or narrow waterways,
        while larger models are built for industrial and commercial use.
    </p>

    <p>
        This flexibility allows us to target two major markets. On one side, everyday consumers who want to clean
        their household water systems or local rivers. On the other, large companies and organizations that rely
        on vast bodies of water and want sustainable, cost-effective cleanup solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        We plan to market smaller units through social media and online campaigns, while larger systems will be sold
        through direct pitches to companies. All sales will occur through our website to keep costs low and maintain
        quality control.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of pricing, our production costs range from $75 for small units to $200–250 for large ones.
        These will retail from $100 up to $300, ensuring strong margins while remaining affordable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our long-term goal is to become a globally recognized environmental technology company. Each Deplasticer is
        expected to remove 10 to 30 kilograms of plastic, depending on its size and environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our unique filtration layout, modular design, and strong accessibility-focused brand create a clear barrier
        to competition.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
        At WorldOfUs, we empower people to become environmental changemakers,
        <b>one body of water at a time.</b>
        </strong>
